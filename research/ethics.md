## CORE TCPS
Before you apply for ethics, you will have to complete a full free course on research ethics and receive the certificate of completion. This is available through the [Goverment of Canada's Panel of Research Ethics website](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/education_tutorial-didacticiel.html). Once completed, please send the certificate to Yumi and then you can start gathering the necessary information to apply for ethics.

## Ethics Application

There are a two ways that you can obtain ethics for your study: New Protocol or an Amendment. 

### Amendments

If your study matches the criteria of available ethics for previous studies in the lab, you are able to [AMEND](https://umanitoba.ca/research/orec/media/Amendment_Request_Form.pdf) the previous ethics to fit the criteria of your current study. This method is recommended if there are ethics available however, you must make sure that the reason for amendment is coherent and strong, otherwise it has a high chance of being rejected. Please ask Yumi whether this method will work for you. **THIS METHOD CAN TAKE UP TO TWO WEEKS**

### New Protocol

If your study does not have amendable ethics, you will have to start a new application for approval. The REB [provides a checklist and forms](https://umanitoba.ca/research/orec/ethics/reb_forms.html) to fill out and send in. On
