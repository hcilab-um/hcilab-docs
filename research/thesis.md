## Advisory Committee (Within 8 Months of Admission)

Each thesis MSc student and PhD student must have an advisory committee appointed within eight months of the start of the student’s program. This committee provides research advice and guidance; often, advisory committee members have expertise in a related field of research that complement those of the advisor(s). The advisory committee consists of the advisor (and co-advisor, if any) and two additional members. These additional members must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

Please consult Dr. Irani about your advisory committee and get the paperwork completed as soon as you can!

## Thesis Proposal

In this lab, for both the M.Sc and Ph.D programs, you are required to complete a thesis proposal and proposal presentation to obtain feedback and suggestions for your project. You would typically write your proposal, send it to your committee, present it to your committee, and accomodate the feedback prior to sending it to the department.

### MSc Proposal Guidelines
A thesis proposal is a written document that must include a preliminary review of pertinent previous work related to the student’s proposed research area, a specification of the research topic, a broad formulation of possible research question(s), a description of planned steps to complete the proposed research, including a rough timeline (to the degree to which this is possible at this stage), and a bibliography. The document is intended to allow the student’s advisory committee and the Department of Computer Science Graduate Studies Committee to assess the likelihood that the proposed topic has the potential to be developed into an appropriate MSc thesis.
Your thesis proposal is expected to be between five to eight double-spaced, single column pages in length, not including the bibliography, and no more than fifteen pages plus the bibliography.

Your advisory committee will review the proposal using [this form](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/MSCThesisProposalReviewForm.doc).

Once the proposal has been approved by the committee Dr. Irani will submit the submission form to the Department for review, and revisions for the proposal must be completed within 2 months.

### Ph.D Proposal Guidelines

Ph.D proposals are similar to MSc proposals, however, expectations are much higher. On top of the proposed research area, a specification of the research topic, a broad formulation of possible research question(s), including justification of the originality, quality, and substance of the proposed topic’s suitability for PhD calibre research, a description of planned steps to complete the proposed research is also required.

Your proposal is expected to be at most fifteen double-spaced pages in length, not including the bibliography and normally completed during the first 18 months of the program. The proposal is also required to be approved prior to your candidacy exam.

### Ph.D Candidacy Exam
**Taken from the Handbook**

The purpose of the candidacy examination is to ascertain whether a student is capable of independent thought and research, has sufficient knowledge of current research and methodologies in all areas relevant to his or her thesis research, and is likely to produce a successful PhD thesis. The candidate is to prepare a written description of the research being undertaken which should include a survey of a significant portion of the relevant literature and provide insight into the thesis progress, both current and planned future research. This document is to be delivered to all Advisory Committee members at least two weeks before the examination date. The examination will be attended only by the candidate, the Advisory Committee, and a member of the GSC who is not on the Advisory Committee and who will act as Chair. The examination will be oral and will begin with a 20-30 minute presentation by the candidate on background research done to date as well as an outline of planned future thesis research. The presentation will be followed by a maximum of two hours of questioning by the Committee. The intent of the questioning is to ascertain the student's breadth and depth of competency in his or her intended research area, and his or her ability to carry out the planned research. Following the examination, the Advisory Committee will determine whether the outcome is a pass or failure. The Chair will communicate the result to the candidate, the department, and FGS.

The candidacy examination should normally be completed during the first 30 months of the program, and cannot precede the approval of the thesis proposal. Extensions are possible if necessary, but delays will be flagged on progress reports. 

To allow sufficient time for a GSC chair to be appointed, a [PhD Candidacy Exam Booking form](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/candidacy_booking_form.pdf) must be submitted to the Academic Administrative Assistant at least two weeks prior to the scheduled candidacy exam date.

## Thesis

Both the MSc and PhD theses must adhere to the [guidelines set by the Faculty of Graduate Studies](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/thesis/guidelines.html). Theses that do not follow the guidelines will not be accepted by FGS.

There are a few templates that can be used to write your thesis. The popular ones used in this lab are:

## Thesis Defenses

Hang in there, you are almost done! These are next steps after writing your thesis.

### MSc Examining Committee

An MSc Thesis Examining Committee consists of the advisor (and co-advisor, if any) and a minimum of two other examiners, one of whom must be from outside the Department of Computer Science. Note that Adjunct Professors in Computer Science at the University of Manitoba hold an appointment in the Department of Computer Science, and are not eligible to represent a department or unit external to Computer Science on an MSc Thesis Examining committee. With the exception of at most one member, the examiners must belong to the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the University of Manitoba. It is common for an MSc student’s Advisory Committee to also serve as that student’s Thesis Examining Committee, if it meets the requirements defined above. 

The student’s advisor will recommend a suggested Thesis Examining Committee by completing a Master’s Thesis/Practicum Title and Appointment of Examiners form (available from the Department of Computer Science website). The completed form is to be submitted to the Academic Administrative Assistant, who will forward the form to the Department Head for approval, before submitting the form to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The form must be submitted at least one month before the defence date to consider the appropriateness of committee members.  It will be the duty of the examiners to examine and report on the student’s thesis. 

In certain instances, the advisor may wish to recommend an external examiner from outside the University of Manitoba.  Prior to recommendation to the Faculty of Graduate Studies via the Master’s [Thesis/Practicum Title](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/defense_booking_form.doc) and [Appointment of Examiners](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/forms/index.html) form, an informal inquiry as to the external examiner’s willingness to serve should be made by the thesis advisor.

### PhD Examining Committee

The PhD Thesis Examining Committee consists of internal examiners (the candidate’s advisors, one additional member of the Department of Computer Science, and one member from another unit at the University of Manitoba) and one external examiner. Normally, the internal examiners are members of the student’s Advisory Committee; see Advisory Committee. All internal examiners must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies (i.e., they must hold an appointment at the University of Manitoba as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, Adjunct Professor, Professor Emeritus, or Senior Scholar). In the case of an advisor and co-advisor, both together have a single vote on the examining committee.

The candidate’s advisor/co-advisor will recommend to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies the names of three distinguished scholars from outside the University of Manitoba to serve as the external examiner. The Dean will choose the external examiner from the list provided and will make the formal invitation to the external examiner. No contact should be made with any of the prospective external examiners. The external examiner must hold a PhD or equivalent, hold the rank of Associate Professor, Full Professor, Senior Scholar or Professor Emeritus at a university, have an established reputation in the area of the thesis research, be able to judge whether the thesis would be acceptable at an institution comparable to the University of Manitoba, and have a demonstrated record of supervising PhD students to completion.

### MSc Defense

The Department of Computer Science requires that Master's students give an oral presentation of the results of their thesis research as part of a defence of the thesis. Attendance at the defence is open to all members of the University community and to the public. The defence is chaired by a member of the GSC selected by the Graduate Associate Head (who will find an alternate if no member of GSC is available).

The defence will begin with a 20-30 minute oral presentation by the candidate of the results of the thesis research.  This will be followed by two rounds of questions put to the candidate by each member of the examining committee. The advisor may pose questions on behalf of members of the examining committee who are unable to be present. Questioning may be extended if necessary but only under exceptional circumstances should the total time for questions be allowed to exceed 60 minutes. If time permits, following these two rounds of questions the chair may allow an opportunity for questions by other members of the University community in attendance.  The chair will note that questions from outside the examining committee will have no bearing on the committee’s deliberations.

Following completion of the oral examination, the chair will request all but the examining committee to leave the examination room, and will then survey the examiners for their decisions on the thesis and the defence and obtain their signatures in the appropriate places on the Master’s Thesis/Practicum Final Report form. If two or more examiners, or one or more of the examiners and the chair, do not approve the defence, the student will be deemed to have failed the defence.

### PhD Defense
The final examination for the PhD degree proceeds in three stages: 

    1.Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an internal examining committee.

    2.Examination of the candidate’s thesis by an external examiner.

    3.Oral examination of the candidate by all examiners on the subject of the thesis.

The Oral Examination will be conducted by the Examining Committee plus a representative from the Faculty of Graduate Studies who will serve as Chair. The Oral Examination is open to all members of the University community. See the [Faculty of Graduate Studies PhD Oral Examination Information](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/thesis/phdoegi.html) for details. A student who receives a failure on either the written thesis or the oral examination twice shall be required to withdraw from the program.

## Thesis Submission

Following the examination, you will have to make any revisions from the feedback you received from your committee and then submit the thesis to [MSpace](https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/), along with the [Copyright Form](https://www.umanitoba.ca/libraries/collections/thesis/copyright_form.php), and the [Final Report](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/graduate_studies/media/MastersThesisPracticumFinalReport.pdf) if you are a MSC student.
