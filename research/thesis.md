# Thesis Program

You are required to complete a thesis and defend it in order to graduate. This section will provide you with the necessary info on what you need to do to stay on track with your programs.

After following the steps in the [Research - Getting Started](research/startresearch) page, there are multiple tasks you are required to do prior to starting your thesis.

## Advisory Committee (Within 8 Months of Admission)

Each thesis MSc student and PhD student must have an advisory committee appointed within eight months of the start of the student’s program. This committee provides research advice and guidance; often, advisory committee members have expertise in a related field of research that complement those of the advisor(s). The advisory committee consists of the advisor (and co-advisor, if any) and two additional members. These additional members must be members of the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

Please consult Dr. Irani about your advisory committee and get the paperwork completed as soon as you can!

## Thesis Proposal

In this lab, for both the M.Sc and Ph.D programs, you are required to complete a thesis proposal and proposal presentation to obtain feedback and suggestions for your project. You would typically write your proposal, send it to your committee, present it to your committee, and accomodate the feedback prior to sending it to the department.

### MSc Proposal Guidelines
A thesis proposal is a written document that must include a preliminary review of pertinent previous work related to the student’s proposed research area, a specification of the research topic, a broad formulation of possible research question(s), a description of planned steps to complete the proposed research, including a rough timeline (to the degree to which this is possible at this stage), and a bibliography. The document is intended to allow the student’s advisory committee and the Department of Computer Science Graduate Studies Committee to assess the likelihood that the proposed topic has the potential to be developed into an appropriate MSc thesis.
Your thesis proposal is expected to be between five to eight double-spaced, single column pages in length, not including the bibliography, and no more than fifteen pages plus the bibliography.

Your advisory committee will review the proposal using [this form](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/MSCThesisProposalReviewForm.doc).

Once the proposal has been approved by the committee Dr. Irani will submit the submission form to the Department for review, and revisions for the proposal must be completed within 2 months.

### Ph.D Proposal Guidelines

Ph.D proposals are similar to MSc proposals, however, expectations are much higher. On top of the proposed research area, a specification of the research topic, a broad formulation of possible research question(s), including justification of the originality, quality, and substance of the proposed topic’s suitability for PhD calibre research, a description of planned steps to complete the proposed research is also required.

Your proposal is expected to be at most fifteen double-spaced pages in length, not including the bibliography and normally completed during the first 18 months of the program. The proposal is also required to be approved prior to your candidacy exam.
