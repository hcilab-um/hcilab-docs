## Lab Etiquette

If you are running a study, make sure that you notify everyone in the lab that you will have participants. It is a good idea to give lab members some notice of what times you are expecting participants for a few reasons:

* To reduce the amount of noise and distractions for the participants (which may affect results).
* To give your peers sufficient time to plan and make alternative arrangements to work.
* If your study involves distractions such as sounds, excessive noises, and changes to the environment such as lighting changes, object movement, etc... The notification will let your fellow colleagues know what to expect.

If you are working while there is a study being conducted please make sure that you respect the following rules:

* **Please be quiet and keep noise levels to minimum to nothing.** If you need to talk to someone, either message them on Slack or take the conversation outside.
* Running a study is stressful, if a participant arrives before the study runner is ready, try to greet them and have them wait a little bit.
* Don't touch the set-up until the study is completed. The study needs to be reproduced multiple times with the exact same conditions.


## Study Tips

* Remember to greet your participants and introduce yourself. Add this to your study script so you won't forget!
* Keep things consistent across all of the studies conducted.
* **KEEP A NOTEBOOK WITH YOU AND WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING!** Keep notes on errors and notable moments of the study.
* Make sure all forms are signed and dated by your participant and yourself where applicable.

## Gift Cards
You will most likely need gift cards as compensation for people participating in your study. Once you are ready to conduct your study, please allow **ONE WEEK** for gift cards to be ordered. Gift cards can be ordered through Yumi.

## Recruiting Participants

### Study Posters
Gathering participants for your study isn't an easy task. Luckily, after completing ethics you should have a poster that you can post around the University. Here is a list of locations and where you can get approval stamps for your posters:

| Location                                    | Approval Stamp Office                             |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 4th Floor & 5th Floor (CS Floors)           | E2-445                                            |
| EITC (All)                                  | Engineering Deans Office - E2-290                 |
| University Centre (UMSU Boards)             | Answers (101 University Centre)                   |
| Frank Kennedy Centre / Active Living Centre | TBD                                               |
| Science Complex (SSA Boards)                | Science Student Association - 209E Armes Building |

**POSTERS WITHOUT APPROVAL STAMPS WILL BE TAKEN DOWN!** 

### Mailing List
Some of the lab members have an email list of participants who have participated in studies in the past and have agreed to be part of an email list. Talk to some of the senior lab members to access that email list and advertise your study. 

## Scheduling Studies
* Try to give yourself some time to prepare for each session. 
* Don't schedule back to back studies sessions without a decent amount of time in-between in case of:
    * Participants requiring extra time
    * Ample time to charge or prepare resources
    * YOU WILL NEED SOME TIME TO BREATHE!
* Look at using scheduling software such as [Meetingbird](https://meetingbird.com/) or [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to help you schedule your sessions. It will make your life so much easier.
    * NOTE: Both applications integrate with Google Calendar and essentially looks at your available and let participants choose and book slots for meetings.
* Promptly answer your emails! The longer you wait to reply, the longer it will take to schedule your studies.

## Data Analysis

### Statistical Analysis
Understanding a little bit of statistics will go a long way. Take some time to go over popular analytical tests if you don't already know them. Some examples of commonly used tests include:
* Mann-Whitney U Test
* ANOVA
* Kruskal-Wallis Test
* Regression

You can also learn how to perform these tests using tools such as [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software) (Discuss with Yumi for access), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (Free), [Python](https://www.python.org/) (Free). There are MANY guides out there for each tool, here are some examples:
* [SPSS Guide](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/basics/)
* [Python Stats Guide](https://realpython.com/python-statistics/)
* [R Stats Guide](sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/R/R-Manual/R-Manual-TOC.html)

### Visualizing Data
Excel isn't the only application that can create graphs and visualizations! Take a look at [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization) which is free for students or the tools above to help you create meaningful visualizations of your data.

## Paperwork
Any forms and questionnaires acquired from these studies need to be stored for a certain amount of time. When you are done with the study and analysis, please neatly place all the forms in a box/envelope, label it with the study name and ethics ID, and give it to Yumi for safe-keeping.
