# Writing and Presenting

Writing can be tough, especially at a level where what you are writing will potentially be publish in a conference proeeding or journal. This section will provide resources on where you kind find help for you writing.

## Writing

### Summary and Abstracts
Something that you should be always improving and master is the summarizing your research and projects. You will be summarizing your research for applications, for abstracts, for elevator pitches. Having a solid two to three paragraph summary handy will go a long way. If you are having problems, members of the lab would be more than happy to help you edit and read your writing.

### Papers
Depending on the conference and the type of paper you are writing, the style is going to change. For example, you will have to be less technical and more detailed when writing for a health conference versus an HCI/CS conference. The writing for papers should be concise, yet, informative as you do not have a lot of space to write. Short papers are typically 4-6 pages including references and long papers are typically 8-10 pages including references. 

Always check the template the conference requires before submitting the writing. Most conferences are strict on the style and the template of the paper, and your work will be rejected if you do not follow the rules. You should always be working towards a paper for a conference. There are some conferences that take priority such as the Computer Human Interaction conference (CHI) and UBICOMP which you should be trying to get into during your program. A list of conference and their due dates can be found in the [Lab Calendar](important_info/labcalendar) section of the guide. 

### Thesis
Thesis writing should be more formal. Try to be descriptive and include anything you can. A thesis should be more than 50 pages with references and images. The goal of a thesis is not only to describe your research and results, but also describe how one can reproduce the research if needed. Try to always be descriptive when writing and it does not have to be concise!

## Presentations

Public speaking is one of the hardest things to do. If you are scared of presenting, you're not alone! [Fear of public speaking is quite common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10501711) and requires a lot of practice to feel more comfortable. Creating a presentation is just as hard. Check out these guides to help you get started:

### Rehearsing
There are plenty of opportunities to practice your public speaking. Lab meetings are a great way to practice presenting your work. You are expected to present every once in a while! There are also great competitions such as [Three Minute Thesis](http://umanitoba.ca/3mt/) to help you practice your public speaking.
