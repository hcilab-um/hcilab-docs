# New Students

## Goals/Objectives

It is important to communicate your ultimate career goal and aspirations with Dr. Irani as early as possible. This could be continuing on with a PhD, a post-doc, aspiring towards an academic career, working in high-tech, or working in any field of your personal passion. Identifying and communicating that goal will allow you and your supervisor to work collaboratively towards that direction.

## Beginning of Program

At the beginning of your program, there are a few things you may want to do right away. This section will provide a list of tasks that you may want to do:

### First Steps
- [ ] Set up a meet and greet with Dr. Irani and Dr. Sakamoto. Prepare to talk about your move to Winnipeg (international students), and your broad research and career plan (e.g., time-line, what you would like to focus on, and major goals). You will not need to commit to your plans at this point. 


- [ ] Make sure that you are enrolled in both the University and the Computer Science Department


### Registration

- [ ] Register for your courses! Make sure to check the deadline for this as some courses become full really quickly, you should register for your selected courses as soon as possible. (Talk to Dr.Irani and Lynne)


- [ ] Obtain your UManitoba student card at the [Registrar's Office](resources/contactinfo).


- [ ] Obtain your bus pass at `Answers` in the University Centre. A student card is required, and the UPASS is part of your tuition.


- [ ] Get a Canadian phone plan (OPTIONAL)


- [ ] Set-up a bank account if you are being funded. Recommended banks: [Royal Bank of Canada](rbc.com), [CIBC](cibc.ca). (RBC is international friendly, not sure about CIBC).

### Workspace Setup

- [ ] Set-up your space in the lab (your desk and the computer).


- [ ] Set-up your computer and obtain a CS account with [Jeff](resources/contactinfo) in E2-594. An application form and Dr. Irani's signature is required.


- [ ] Obtain a key to E2-560 from the Computer Science office in E2-445. [Lynne](resources/contactinfo) will need a few pieces of information to you prior to getting a key. COST FOR A LOST KEY IS $25!


- [ ] Activate your student card to access E2-568 and the Graduate Student Lounge (OPTIONAL). [FILL OUT THIS FORM](https://umanitoba.ca/campus/physical_plant/media/Card_Access_Approval_Form.pdf), bring it to Dr. Irani for a signature and then bring it to Lynne for further instructions.
