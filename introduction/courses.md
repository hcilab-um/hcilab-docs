# Courses and YOU!

## Before Registration

You must consult with Dr. Irani about the courses you would like to take prior to registration. This consultation is to help you choose the right courses that may help you with your research. You can find the list of graduate courses on [Aurora](aurora.umanitoba.ca) or on the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/courses/) page. The course list for the next year normally gets released in April! Once you have your courses picked out, fill out the [CS Course Registration Form](http://cs.umanitoba.ca/perch/resources/1317222322grad.reg.pdf) and send it to [Lynne](resources/contactinfo).

## Requirements

All graduate courses are numbered as 7XXX (ie. COMP 7210). Content is excerpted from the [CS Graduate Handbook](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/cs_graduate_handbook-may2018.pdf), which is a recommended read.

### Minimum Grade

Students in graduate programs in Computer Science are required to maintain a minimum degree grade point average of 3.0 (B) with no grade below C+.

### Course Categories

Graduate courses in the Department of Computer Science are categorized by GSC for breadth purposes as being in one of three areas: Systems, Theory, or Applications. Students should be proactive in choosing course areas to satisfy the breadth requirements of their program; there is no guarantee that any particular course will be offered in any given year.

### M. Sc Students

A minimum of 15 credit hours of coursework is required (five courses). Of these five courses, one must be Research Methodologies (COMP 7210), to be completed at the earliest possible opportunity, at least three must be graduate courses in Computer Science, including courses in at least two of the three areas (Theory, Applications, and Systems). The fifth course can be any graduate course in Computer Science or any graduate course from another department (APPROVAL REQUIRED BY THE CS DEPARTMENT). The student is expected to complete the course requirements during the first 16 months of the thesis MSc program.

### Ph. D Students

A minimum of 12 credit hours of courses at the 7000 level is required beyond the MSc degree, typically corresponding to at least four graduate courses taken during the PhD program. Of these four courses, at least three must be graduate courses in Computer Science, including at least one course in each of the three areas (Theory, Applications, and Systems). The fourth course can be any graduate course in Computer Science or any graduate course from another department (APPROVAL REQUIRED BY THE CS DEPARTMENT). The student is expected to complete the course requirements during the first 24 months of the PhD program. 

### Re-Registration

All graduate students must register for the regular session in mid-July, during the week specified in the Academic Schedule,  available  on  the  University  of  Manitoba  website.  Candidates  should  discuss  their  programs  with  their  advisor before registration. Accepted students who fail to appear and register by the end of the registration period stated on their letter of acceptance will not be admitted unless special prior arrangements have been made with the  Head  of  the  Department.  Questions  about  the  registration  process  can  be  directed  to  the  Academic  Administrative Assistant or by speaking with a member of the department in the Computer Science office (EITC E2-445). 

Any student whose program of study extends over more than one year must re-register in each succeeding year of the program (both terms) until the degree is obtained. This applies even in the case where the only remaining degree requirement is the final submission of the thesis. Students who fail to re-register will not retain the status of graduate student and must apply for re-admission if they wish to continue studies at a later date.
