## All-Year Round

### The Forks

The Forks, located at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, has been a meeting place for over 6,000 years. Indigenous peoples traded at The Forks, followed by European fur traders, Scottish settlers, railway pioneers and tens of thousands of immigrants. 

Come experience an exceptional array of dining options, fantastic local makers and retailers, a constantly changing slate of entertainment and events, and many unique attractions that encompass the site’s natural, historic and built features.

For over a century, Assiniboine Park has served Winnipeg as a hub of year-round activity, a joyful gathering place, and a natural oasis that allows visitors to reconnect with nature and each other.

The Park is home to popular attractions, like the Assiniboine Park Zoo, Qualico Family Centre, and Leo Mol Sculpture Garden. Winding trails, wide open green spaces, and breathtaking gardens encourage people to get outdoors and be active. Educational programs, free outdoor concerts at the Lyric Theatre, public art galleries, unique event venues, and a great variety of events and activities provide amazing opportunities for learning, celebration and recreation.

With attractions that blend the best of physical activity, sight-seeing, dining and nature into one unforgettable experience, Assiniboine Park is the perfect place to relax and play in every season.

### The Exchange District

The Exchange District, a National Historic Site, features North America’s largest and best preserved collection of heritage buildings which include beautiful and massive stone and brick warehouses, elegant terracotta-clad buildings, narrow angled streets and cobblestone paths.

The architecture provides a stunning backdrop for local restaurants, boutique shops, art galleries, museums and attractions.

Old Market Square is a beautiful urban green space in the heart of the Exchange and is home to the city’s most popular summer festivals including Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival and the TD Winnipeg International Jazz Festival.

Surrounding Old Market Square are numerous art studios, workshop spaces and galleries along with unique boutiques, health and wellness spaces, cafes, bistros and more.

Everything is so close when you’re in the Exchange District so make it your source for year-round entertainment with the Centennial Concert Hall, The Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, The Manitoba Museum and the Pantages Playhouse Theatre. Winnipeg’s film industry is also thriving in the District with the iconic Artspace building and Cinematheque.

Waterfront Drive is yet another highlight of the Exchange District. Marrying heritage buildings with the edges of the historic Red River, Waterfront Drive is a modern day thoroughfare that’s on its way to becoming one of Winnipeg’s most prestigious places to live, work and play. Stephen Juba Park, which runs along Waterfront Drive, offers a scenic place to relax on a sunny afternoon.

This area is quickly becoming the place to be for residents looking for riverfront property and tourists looking for boutique hotel accommodations like the Mere Hotel. This area also serves as a gateway to other popular destinations such as Winnipeg’s French Quarter and The Forks.
