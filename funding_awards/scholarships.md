One of the main ones that you should apply for. This application process is based on the requirements from the CS department. You can access the form here: [UMGF Form](http://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/um_grad_fudning_papplication.pdf). This application is for two awards.

## NSERC

NSERC is a little more complicated. If you access the [NSERC Application Page](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/AppProcess-ProcessusDemande_eng.asp), there are video tutorials on how to apply. NSERC is based on a STRICT timeline, so try to manage yourself to give you enough time to go through the application process for this award.
