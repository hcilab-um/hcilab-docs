# Conference Grants 

This page will share the grants widely available to graduate students. **MOST GRANTS ARE DONE THROUGH REIMBURSEMENTS AND REQUIRE UP TO THREE WEEKS FOR PROCESSING**! Make sure that you account for that if you have a budget.

## Grants
You will have to publish a few papers during your program. When you publish a paper, you will most likely have to go and give a presentation in a different city. Travelling can get expensive so there are a few grants that help you with your accomodations. Most grants require you to sign up first, and then after the conference, you will submit a report and the receipts in order to get the award. A lot of grants also have **YEARLY** quotas. So if the quota is $750, then once you ask for $750, you cannot ask for more until the next year. You also cannot ask for more than what you have spent and you cannot ask for double awards. Essentially you cannot ask for more than your receipt totals across all awards.

## Tips

* **NO RECEIPTS, NO MONEY!**
* As soon as you purchase something that can be claimed TAKE A PICTURE OF THE RECEIPT AND UPLOADED INTO A FOLDER ON GOOGLE DRIVE! (It will make your life easier).
* Once all your receipts are uploaded, compile them in a document like this: [Receipt Compilation Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IH4ue910oX-h10i-lC_auZAIMhsRFAz3qru2h-CyhA/edit?usp=sharing)
* **KEEP YOUR BOARDING PASSES / TAKE SCREENSHOTS / TAKE PHOTOS! You will need to submit it.**
* **KEEP YOUR CONFERENCE NAME BADGE! You will need to submit it.** 
* **KEEP YOUR CONFERENCE PROGRAM!**
* You can only ask for up to the totalling amount of your receipts. Try to spread them out between different sources of award.
* If another award already covers the trip, you cannot ask for more. **THEY WILL KNOW!**
* Got funding from a NSERC Program? Please contact and see if they have a travel grant program! (ie. VADA)
