# Lab Information

## Introduction

This section serves as a page that you can quickly refer to for some useful quick links that pertain to the experience in the lab and the school. Before reading this section, [First Steps](introduction/prep) should be completed.

## Lab Rules

On top of the responsibilities outlined in [the Responsibilities section of the First Steps page](introduction/prep?id=responsibilities) and the [Expectations](introduction/expectations) there are a few important rules with regards to room usage and lab security to ensure a safe workspace.

* For any room, if you are the only person in the room and you leave, **MAKE SURE YOU SHUT THE DOOR COMPLETELY**. Sometimes the door is propped open, so if you are the last one out, unprop the door and make sure it is locked.

* **E2-568 has a special security system installed**. If you are the first one in the morning or the last one out in the evening, make sure you properly arm/disarm the alarm! Ask any lab member on how to use the E2-568 security system. Failure to disarm the alarm within the alloted time will alert the UManitoba security and they will respond. 

* As a general rule, do not give your student card to anyone. E2-568 is a card access room with many irreplacible items and could affect your work if stolen! 

* **E2-560 should stay locked at all times!** If you open the door with a key, make sure that you lock it before you go in. You can prop the door open if there are others in the lab.

* Food etiquette:

    * There is a small fridge in E2-560 available for use to store food.

    * It is your responsibility to clear out the fridge if you bring food as we do not want a build up of **Mold**.

    * Make sure to **throw away** perishable foods and clean up the area you eat in as there has been rat/cockroach problems in the past!

* In general, keep your space clean, and throw away unnecessary items that may cause unwanted pests to show.

## Room Access

As a member of this lab, you will gain access to a few rooms, mainly, E2-560 and E2-568. 

### E2-560

This room is only accessible by a key obtained from the CS Office in E2-445. The key is obtained through when you go through the [first steps](introduction/prep). This room contains our 3D printers as well as the location for all our Lab meetings and some of the studies the lab runs. A projector setup is available to practice presentations as well.

### E2-568

This room is only accessible via card access obtained through the [first steps](introduction/prep). This lab is home to most of the hardware, which is why it is important to keep the lab secure at all times. Take a moment to go through the security system and make sure that if you are the last one out to properly secure the room prior to leaving. The room features a fully speced CAVE environment for motion capture studies.

## Other Rooms

As a member of the CS Department you will also have access to a few computer labs and printers. Before you gain access to them, an account has to be created with Jeff as outlined in the first steps. The combination for these rooms change every once in a while to ensure the security of the room. For up-to-date information on the rooms that are available to you, go to the [Room Usage and Combos Locks](https://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~gedetil/facilities/usage.html) page in the [The Unofficial Guide to Computing Facilities](https://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~gedetil/facilities/index.html) by logging into the CS account you made with Jeff and then use the web-based script available on the Combo Locks page.

### Study Rooms / Meeting Rooms

Both labs are full and there are times where you may want to have group meetings with non-lab members about your coursework projects. If the lab is not available for use due to studies in progress or during deadline seasons for conferences, there are many spaces available for booking. You can book study rooms located in the respective libraries on the [Study Room Booking](https://libguides.lib.umanitoba.ca/c.php?g=705915&p=503487) page. The room bookings are associated with your UManitoba account [ie. lastnamef@myumanitoba.ca | lastnamef] and if you book a room with the engineering library, the booking will reflect on your student card to gain access. Most rooms can be booked **two weeks in advance** so try to book it early as they get taken fairly fast.
