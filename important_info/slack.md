# Communication

## Slack

In this lab we use a team communication application called '[Slack](https://slack.com)'.

## Setup

To get started on Slack you can download the desktop and/or the mobile application and then ask Yumi for an invitation to the Slack group.

## Stand-up

A channel that you should be contributing to daily is the #stand-up channel. You should be automatically added into the channel when you first join the group. In the case that you are not, you can click the + icon beside the `Channels` header and join the channel.

In this channel you will be keeping track of your tasks. Each day you will be contributing a YTB.

```
Y: Yesterday
What did you do yesterday?
T: Today
What are you doing today?
B: Blocking (OPTIONAL)
Is there anything blocking you?
```

Here is an example:
```
Y:
    * Implementation of NRP Game
    * Configure ventilator mask
    * Calibrate sensors
T:
    * Running pilot studies
    * adjust implementation based on studies
B:
    * Need participants!
```

The blocking point is extremely useful as other members of the lab can see and potentially help you with your block.
